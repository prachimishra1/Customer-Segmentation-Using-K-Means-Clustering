Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

Overview:
   Customer segmentation is a crucial part of modern marketing strategies. It helps businesses understand their customers better,
personalize marketing campaigns, and increase customer satisfaction. In this project, we implement K-Means Clustering to group customers 
based on their behavior and spending patterns, providing valuable insights into customer segments for targeted marketing.

1. Project Overview
    
     In this project, we use the K-Means Clustering algorithm to group customers into different segments based on their purchasing behavior. By analyzing customer data, businesses can target marketing strategies more effectively, improve customer retention, and provide personalized product recommendations.

3. Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

CustomerID: Unique ID assigned to each customer.
Age: Age of the customer.
Annual Income: Annual income of the customer in dollars.
Spending Score: A score assigned to the customer based on their purchasing behavior (1â€“100).

3. Prerequisites:
   
To run this project, you need the following libraries installed:

  Python (3.x)
  NumPy
  Pandas
  Matplotlib
  Seaborn
  Scikit-learn
  
Install the necessary libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

4. Project Workflow:

  Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
  
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the data distribution.

  Applying K-Means Clustering: Using the K-Means algorithm to create customer segments.

  Choosing the Optimal K: Using the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters.

  Visualization of Clusters: Visualizing customer segments using 2D plots.

5. K-Means Clustering Algorithm:
   
K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups similar data points into K clusters. The algorithm works by:

Randomly initializing cluster centroids.

Assigning each data point to the nearest centroid.

Updating the centroid positions based on the data points assigned to each cluster.

Repeating the process until the centroids stop changing significantly.

Elbow Method: We use this technique to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the sum of squared distances (inertia)
              for different values of K. The point at which the reduction in inertia slows down significantly is considered the best K.

6. Visualization:
   
     The clustering results are visualized using scatter plots, where each cluster is represented by different colors.
    These visualizations help in interpreting customer segments, such as:

         High-income and high-spending customers

         Low-income but frequent buyers

         Medium-income with varied spending scores
   

7. Results:
   
    After running the K-Means algorithm, customers are divided into distinct segments based on their spending habits and annual income. For instance, the clusters may show:

Cluster 1: High-income, high-spending customers.

Cluster 2: Low-income, low-spending customers.

Cluster 3: Medium-income, medium-spending customers.

These insights help businesses develop personalized marketing strategies to better serve each customer group.

8. Conclusion:
      This project demonstrates how K-Means Clustering can be used for customer segmentation, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing.
   By identifying different customer segments, businesses can optimize their marketing efforts, improve customer satisfaction, and increase overall profitability.
